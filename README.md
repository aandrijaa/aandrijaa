👋🏻 Hi, my name is Andrija

🎓 Soon to be grad with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science, Communication Technologies.

🏙️ Niš Native, with a passion for testing software and making things hassle-free for the end user.

📚 I've tutored peers in high school in Pascal, Microsoft Access, HTML & CSS. Being a fan of tech in general I find myself enjoying most of the products I've worked with over the years. Being an end user myself for a lot of new tech I've experienced a lot of faults in products I have paid for, so I took the first chance that appeared and started testing products before their release, product I would be an end user for. That is how I came to realize testing is something I would love to do for living as it is something that can only help other people. I hope to one day work with a diverse team and make everyones life better with testing products.

⌨️ In my free time I love building mechanical keyboards for friends.

💪🏻 Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, MySQL, Algorithms, written and spoken English.
